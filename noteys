scaling rules for increasing num ppl
generalize relationship between colors to freq stuff for synthesis
pix appear as grid but just consider order (order joined) for pattern
when impulse received start playing tone according to current total pattern
tone should smooth glide over to new pattern's tone when pattern changes

base freqs..?

red  
orange
yellow
green
blue
'indigo'
violet


1 pix - pattern is one note
2 pix - two notes etc.





user
  choose color of pixel
  add more pixel?
  tap to start impulse

  change your place in order? up/down






on connection
  give client id
  initialize color


in server
  store current pixel 







impll
  color passed into pixel to display
  colors used to determine frequency of playednote
  function to play notes from current pixel sequence
    plays various notes over time according to current color configuration, then repeats until pixel color change

  note class that creates osc with freq + gain, fades up and down gain with adsr args
  





in order to have sync
  react app adds/removes dom elements



start seq in web worker
  just running


use dom elements to represent notes in sequencer
