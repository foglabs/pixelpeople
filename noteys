scaling rules for increasing num ppl
generalize relationship between colors to freq stuff for synthesis
pix appear as grid but just consider order (order joined) for pattern
when impulse received start playing tone according to current total pattern
tone should smooth glide over to new pattern's tone when pattern changes

base freqs..?

1 pix - pattern is one note
2 pix - two notes etc.





user
  choose color of pixel
  add more pixel?
  tap to start impulse

  change your place in order? up/down






on connection
  give client id
  initialize color


in server
  store current pixel 







impll
  color passed into pixel to display
  colors used to determine frequency of playednote
  function to play notes from current pixel sequence
    plays various notes over time according to current color configuration, then repeats until pixel color change

  note class that creates osc with freq + gain, fades up and down gain with adsr args
  





in order to have sync
  react app adds/removes dom elements



start seq in web worker
  just running


use dom elements to represent notes in sequencer





random mode
--
gen numPix random pixels every randomInterval ms
checkbox toggle
click color selector to whitelist colors to be included in random





material ui




extract triad code into method that checks for x-colorwheel-length patterns







2 2 distance matchesw -> primary/triad
  turns every 3 on
2 1 distance matches -> analagous
  s

1 3 distance match -> complementary
  turns every 4 on



right then left

orange 1
yellow 2
  distance 1, distance 5

yellow 2
orange 1
  distance 5, distance 1


violet 5
orange 1
  distance 2, distance 4


blue 4
violet 5

add too many synths, goes WEEEEEOOOO
  inreasing heartbeat time seems to help, but still eventually get to weoo with 20-30synths
  maybe something with loop taking too long and missing ever setting freq?

  can happen temporarily with many randPix but always resolves and clears when next rand comes
    seems to be something related to click events on addPixels


  happens after 10th pixel added?
    resolves after 12th added??







*got pattern sound detection working correctly
  *just need to make first pattern sound have 2x freq, right now its doing 1x


HEY should be able to set whether randomizePixels removes existing



deleting doesnt always work
  with or without psounds enabled, leaves dead synths
  visible on soundshow (stuck 'playing')
  hardstupssed over and over again -> deleting isn't actually deleting in certain circums?
  "Sir Cum"
  possible losing sync between seq and synths?
